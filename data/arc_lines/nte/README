Notes on wavelength calibration success

Orders 8,9,10,11,12,13,14: Good
Order 15: This order is close to and running off from the detector.
          pypeit_identify did not pick up the lines at large pixel values,
          despite the tracing seeming OK.
          
          
I had to change the order 14 files after masking the +/- 1 orders, hence the _unmasked files
